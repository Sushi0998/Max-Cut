Simulated a Markov chain, and calculated the Max-cut (cut of a weighted garph) using a Spin glass model by implementing a acceptance function and receiving a stationary distribution using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
# Beta = 1

The best value come out to be 42
The given the code strictly looks for the best value, the narure of the graph looks a bit linear in upward direction. The chance of getting the best value is likely high for Beta = 1  
# Beta = 0

The best value come out to be 292
the search for the best value if very irregular 
# Beta = -1

The best value come out to be 1231
the given the code strictly looks for the best value and looks a bit linear in downward direction.
