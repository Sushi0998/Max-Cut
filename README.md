# Introduction

Simulated a Markov chain, and calculated the Max-cut (cut of a weighted garph) using a Spin glass model by implementing a acceptance function and receiving a stationary distribution using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

# Beta = 1

The maximum cut value come out to be 42

The given the code strictly looks for the best value, the narure of the graph looks a bit linear in upward direction. The chance of getting the best value is likely high for Beta = 1  

# Beta = 0

The maximum cut value come out to be 192

The search for the best value if very irregular 
# Beta = -1

The maximum cut value come out to be 2165

Yhe given the code strictly looks for the best value and looks a bit linear in downward direction.
